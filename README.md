# üé¢ FastPass+ Queue Simulation  

This project models Disney‚Äôs former **FastPass+ virtual queueing system** using a priority-based M/M/1 queue. By simulating different FastPass allocation levels, the system estimates **average residence times** for FastPass holders (high priority) and regular customers (low priority) under both low and high system load conditions.

The simulator helps determine how many FastPasses can be distributed **without significantly degrading the experience** for either customer group.

## üìö Project Context

From 1999 to 2021, Disney offered FastPasses to let visitors **skip regular queues** by arriving at pre-scheduled times. FastPass holders entered a shorter line, jumping ahead of regular customers ‚Äî creating a **two-class queuing system**.

From a modeling perspective, this is a **priority queue**, where:
- **FastPass customers** are always served before regular ones
- **Regular customers** are repeatedly bypassed, increasing their wait times

The central design question:  
üëâ *How many FastPasses can you issue before regular customer experience becomes unacceptable?*

## üß™ Simulation Model

- **Queue type:** M/M/1 (single-server, exponential interarrival and service times)
- **Customer classes:** FastPass (high priority) and Regular (low priority)
- **Queue behavior:**
  - FastPass holders wait only behind other FastPass holders
  - Regular customers wait behind everyone
- **Server behavior:** First-Come-First-Served (FCFS), non-preemptive
- **Arrival rates (Œª):** 0.50 (low load) and 0.95 (high load)
- **Service rate (Œº):** 1.0 ‚Üí average service time `s = 1 minute`

The simulation runs for 50,000 minutes (with a 5,000-minute warm-up), and computes average **residence times** (waiting + service) for each group as the **FastPass fraction `f`** varies from `0` to `0.95`.

## Sample Outuputs 

![fastpass_results](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a9f92eb-e135-401d-bab9-05ec94618c02)

```
Results for Œª=0.5:
Recommended FastPass fraction: 0.95
  - FastPass residence time: 1.95 minutes
  - Regular residence time: 2.84 minutes
  - Regular/FastPass time ratio: 1.46

Results for Œª=0.95:
Recommended FastPass fraction: 0.65
  - FastPass residence time: 3.42 minutes
  - Regular residence time: 49.15 minutes
  - Regular/FastPass time ratio: 14.39
```

## üéØ Goal

Find a **balanced FastPass allocation fraction `f`** that:
- Keeps FastPass wait times short (the main goal)
- Avoids punishing regular customers with extreme delays
- Adjusts appropriately for high- and low-utilization periods
